I did not have time to go through actual diet/workout plans to gather data. 
Therefore I did not consider which meal/workout should be used for each plan. 
Contents in the plans are not exactly accurate when considering real-life factors. 
I have used only a few meals and workout types in every plan (instead of leaving them empty) just to demonstrate the system's purpose. 
But the code is working perfectly and data can be altered later.
